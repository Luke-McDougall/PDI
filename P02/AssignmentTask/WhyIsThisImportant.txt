Char datatype in Java does not allow arithmetic operations. ASCII values are useful if you want to be able to
perform arithmetic operations on char values e.g. converting an uppercase letter to lowercase by adding 32 to
it. It also makes checking if any paricular byte can represent a valid char easy because there is a defined
range of ASCII values that represent alphanumeric characters.
